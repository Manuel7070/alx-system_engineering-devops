# 0x16. API Advanced

## Overview
Welcome to the **0x16. API Advanced** repository! This project focuses on enhancing your understanding of working with APIs, particularly using the Reddit API. You will gain valuable experience in querying endpoints, handling pagination, parsing JSON responses, making recursive API calls, and sorting dictionary data.

## Background Context
Questions involving APIs are common in interviews and practical scenarios. This project provides an opportunity to practice API usage with the Reddit API, which offers a wide range of endpoints and abundant data for extraction and analysis. Mastering API calls now can greatly benefit you in technical interviews and personal projects.

## Resources
- [Reddit API Documentation](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)
- [Query String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you should be able to:

- Read API documentation to locate desired endpoints
- Utilize an API with pagination for handling large data sets
- Parse JSON results obtained from an API
- Implement recursive API calls for complex data retrieval
- Sort dictionary data by value

## Copyright - Plagiarism
You are expected to solve the tasks independently to achieve the learning objectives. Plagiarism of any form is strictly prohibited and will result in removal from the program.
