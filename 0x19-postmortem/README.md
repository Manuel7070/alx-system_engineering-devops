# 0x19. Postmortem

## Overview
Welcome to the 0x19. Postmortem repository! This project focuses on understanding and learning from system failures by conducting postmortems. As software engineers, it's essential to embrace failure as an opportunity for growth and improvement. The postmortem process allows us to analyze outages, identify root causes, and implement preventative measures to ensure they don't recur.

## Background Context
Any software system can encounter failures due to various factors such as bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, or human error. Failing is a normal part of software development, but it's crucial to learn from mistakes to prevent recurrence. The postmortem process helps teams understand the cause of outages, inform stakeholders about the impact, and take corrective actions.
