## Concepts
For this project, understanding the concept of **Child Process** is crucial.

## Background Context
In this project, tasks are graded on two aspects:
1. Web server configuration adherence to requirements.
2. Presence of a Bash script automating server configuration without human intervention.

A good Software Engineer automates repetitive tasks to focus on more valuable work.

- How the web works
- Nginx
- How to Configure Nginx
