# 0x1A. Application Server

## Overview

Welcome to the 0x1A. Application Server project! In this project, you will add an application server to your existing web infrastructure, which currently serves web pages via Nginx. The application server will handle dynamic content and be integrated with your Nginx setup to serve your Airbnb clone project.

## Background Context

Your web infrastructure is already serving web pages via Nginx, but now it's time to introduce an application server to handle dynamic content. By adding an application server, you can enhance the functionality of your website and provide a better user experience.
