# 0x18. Webstack Monitoring

## Overview
Welcome to the **0x18. Webstack Monitoring** repository! This project focuses on implementing tools for monitoring web stacks, encompassing both application monitoring and server monitoring. By measuring and analyzing the performance of our software systems and servers, we aim to ensure optimal functionality and prevent potential issues.

## Background Context
In the Tech industry, the saying "You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure" holds true. Monitoring our software systems is essential in the age of data-driven decision-making. This project delves into web stack monitoring, covering application monitoring to ensure software behavior and server monitoring to prevent overload.

## Resources

- [Nginx logging and monitoring](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/logging/)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the need for monitoring in software systems.
- Identify the two main areas of monitoring: application and server.
- Understand the purpose of access logs for web servers (e.g., Nginx).
- Recognize the significance of error logs for web servers (e.g., Nginx).

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All Bash script files must be executable
- Your Bash script must pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.7) without any error
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script is doing
